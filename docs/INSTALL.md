# Install once. Watch the whole Mac.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swordfish444/BurnZombies/main/install.sh | bash
```

macOS 14+, Apple Silicon or Intel. The installer checks the release checksum and signature, installs `~/Applications/BurnZombies.app`, selects an available harness CLI, and starts the menu bar observer in the background. No active chat, special job wrapper or computer reboot is required.

The observer scans visible processes owned by your macOS user across every project and session. Its own schedule requests bounded reviews from the selected harness. Closing your chats does not stop observation or scheduling. Quit BurnZombies to stop the observer; **Start at login** is available in Settings.

## Existing harness, existing login

Codex, Claude Code, Cursor CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI have launch adapters. The selected CLI must be installed and signed in. Codex's bundled desktop CLI is detected when available. A desktop app without a usable local CLI is not sufficient by itself. Authentication is reused, never copied or changed.

Default selection order is Codex, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini. Reinstallation retains the previous provider; a failed or quota-limited provider is never replaced automatically. Reviews use that harness's existing account and usage allowance. Failed authentication, unsupported CLI options, permission refusals or usage errors pause reviews while native observation continues. Resolve the issue in the harness, then use **Resume reviews** in BurnZombies.

Default setup writes only BurnZombies's private reviewer configuration. It does not edit `~/.codex/config.toml`, install chat hooks, inject reminders into conversations, or change persistent tool permissions. Per-run MCP configuration connects the reviewer to the local observer. Legacy BurnZombies hooks become inert when computer-wide review is configured.

## Options

`--mcp codex|claude|cursor|copilot|gemini` selects the review provider; `auto` selects one available provider. The older `all` spelling also selects one provider rather than starting five competing reviewers. `--mcp none` skips reviewer configuration. `--no-open` skips starting the app. `BURNZOMBIES_INSTALL_DIR` changes the app destination.

The native command `burnzombies setup --harness NAME` configures the background reviewer. The older `install` subcommand remains available for explicit interactive MCP/skill integration; chat checkpoints now default off. It is not needed for continuous observation or reviews.

No `--yolo`, blanket permission bypass, account fallback, quarantine removal or Gatekeeper disablement is used. This release is ad-hoc signed, not Developer ID notarized. [Build from source](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if local macOS policy blocks it.

## Acceptance

Check the menu bar observer and its selected harness, then verify a bounded background review and its receipts without sending a chat message. CLI configuration alone is not live model proof. Current validation and remaining harness limits are in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).
